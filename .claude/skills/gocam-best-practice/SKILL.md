# GO-CAM Best Practice Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for creating and editing GO-CAM (Gene Ontology Causal Activity Model) models using the barista command-line tool. GO-CAM models represent biological knowledge as networks of causal relationships between molecular activities.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating new GO-CAM models from biological pathway descriptions
- Editing existing GO-CAM models to add activities or relationships
- Validating GO-CAM models against annotation best practices
- Annotating specific molecular function types (transcription factors, receptors, transporters, etc.)
- Representing complexes, adaptors, carriers, or sequestering proteins
- Adding evidence to support causal relationships

## Core Concepts

### GO-CAM Structure

Every GO-CAM model consists of:
- **Individuals** (nodes): Molecular activities (MF), biological processes (BP), or cellular components (CC)
- **Facts** (edges): Relationships between individuals, including causal relations
- **Evidence**: Publications and evidence codes supporting each fact

### Activity Units

An activity unit is the fundamental building block of GO-CAM models:
- **MF (Molecular Function)**: The activity 'enabled' by a gene product
- **Context**: Additional information via relations like 'has input', 'occurs in', 'part of'
- **Causal Relations**: How this activity affects other activities

## Using the Barista Command-Line Tool

The `barista` command (alias for `noctua barista`) provides tools for model creation and editing.

### Key Commands

#### Viewing Models

```bash
# Export model in Minerva JSON format
barista export-model --model <model-id>

# Export in GO-CAM YAML format
barista export-model --model <model-id> -f gocam-yaml

# List recent models
barista list-models --limit 50

# Search models by gene product
barista list-models --gp UniProtKB:Q14457

# Search models by title
barista list-models --title "immune"
```

#### Creating and Editing Models

```bash
# Create a new empty model
barista create-model

# Add an individual (molecular activity, BP, or CC)
barista add-individual --model <model-id> --class <GO-term> --assign <variable-name>

# Create a relationship between individuals
barista add-fact --model <model-id> \
  --subject <variable-or-id> \
  --object <variable-or-id> \
  --predicate <relation-id>

# Add evidence to support a relationship
barista add-fact-evidence --model <model-id> \
  --subject <variable-or-id> \
  --object <variable-or-id> \
  --evidence <evidence-code> \
  --reference <PMID>
```

### Important Notes

- Commands use the **test server by default**; production requires the explicit `--live` flag
- Use variable names (via `--assign`) for readability when building complex models
- Production models with state="production" are protected against accidental deletion
- Always add evidence to support facts in models

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

### Causal Relationship Selection

Choose the appropriate causal relation:

- **directly positively regulates**: Direct activation (e.g., ligand → receptor, kinase → substrate)
- **directly negatively regulates**: Direct inhibition
- **indirectly positively regulates**: Multi-step activation (e.g., transcription factor → target gene activity)
- **indirectly negatively regulates**: Multi-step inhibition

### Input Specification

Use 'has input' to specify:
- The substrate of an enzyme
- The gene regulated by a transcription factor
- The receptor activated by a ligand
- The effector protein activated by a receptor

**Important**: For receptors, 'has input' specifies the downstream effector, NOT the ligand.

### Complex Representation

Three approaches based on knowledge:

1. **Subunit with activity is known**: Represent the specific protein, not the complex
2. **Subunit with activity unknown**: Use the GO complex term
3. **Activity shared by multiple subunits**: Represent all relevant subunits

### Context Annotations

Always include:
- **CC (Cellular Component)**: Use 'occurs in' to specify location
- **BP (Biological Process)**: Use 'part of' to connect to larger biological processes
- **Evidence**: Support all facts with evidence codes and references

## Workflow for Creating a GO-CAM Model

1. **Plan the model**: Identify the biological pathway or process to represent
2. **Identify gene products**: Determine which gene products are involved
3. **Define activities**: For each gene product, determine its molecular function(s)
4. **Add individuals**: Use `barista add-individual` to create activity nodes
5. **Connect activities**: Use `barista add-fact` to create causal relationships
6. **Add context**: Specify inputs, locations, and processes
7. **Add evidence**: Support all facts with evidence codes and references
8. **Validate**: Check against guidelines in `references/` files
9. **Export and review**: Export the model to review its structure

## Reference File Usage Strategy

When annotating, identify the molecular function type involved and load the corresponding reference file from the list above.

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing a GO-CAM model, verify:
- [ ] All activities have appropriate molecular function terms
- [ ] Causal relations match the biological mechanism (direct vs. indirect)
- [ ] 'has input' relations specify the correct targets
- [ ] Cellular components are specified with 'occurs in'
- [ ] Activities are connected to biological processes with 'part of'
- [ ] All facts have supporting evidence
- [ ] Complex representation follows guidelines
- [ ] Relation directionality is correct (subject → object)

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Kinase Activation

```bash
# Create model
barista create-model --title "MAPK signaling example"

# Add receptor activity
barista add-individual --model $MODEL_ID --class GO:0004888 --assign receptor

# Add kinase activity
barista add-individual --model $MODEL_ID --class GO:0004674 --assign kinase

# Connect with causal relationship
barista add-fact --model $MODEL_ID \
  --subject receptor --object kinase \
  --predicate RO:0002413  # directly positively regulates
```

### Example 2: Transcription Factor with Target Gene

```bash
# Add transcription activator activity
barista add-individual --model $MODEL_ID \
  --class GO:0001228 --assign tf_activity  # DNA-binding transcription activator

# Specify the target gene as input
barista add-fact --model $MODEL_ID \
  --subject tf_activity \
  --object <gene-id> \
  --predicate RO:0002233  # has input

# Add the target gene's molecular function
barista add-individual --model $MODEL_ID \
  --class <target-mf> --assign target_activity

# Connect TF to target activity (indirect regulation)
barista add-fact --model $MODEL_ID \
  --subject tf_activity \
  --object target_activity \
  --predicate RO:0002407  # indirectly positively regulates
```

## Tips for Effective GO-CAM Modeling

1. **Start simple**: Begin with core activities and expand incrementally
2. **Use variables**: Assign readable names to individuals for easier reference
3. **Consult examples**: Refer to example models in the guidelines
4. **Be specific**: Use the most specific GO term and relation available
5. **Document evidence**: Always include supporting references
6. **Test first**: Use test server before committing to production
7. **Review guidelines**: Load relevant reference files before annotating complex cases
8. **Think causally**: Focus on how activities mechanistically affect each other

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using 'has input' to specify a ligand for a receptor (should use causal relation instead)
- Using direct regulation when the mechanism is multi-step (use indirect)
- Forgetting to specify cellular location with 'occurs in'
- Creating activities without connecting them to biological processes
- Missing evidence codes and references
- Using generic terms when specific child terms are available
- Incorrect causal relation directionality

## Getting Help

- Check relevant guideline files in `references/` directory
- Search for similar examples using `barista list-models`
- Export and examine well-annotated models for patterns
- Consult the GO Consortium documentation
- Review the noctua-py documentation at https://github.com/geneontology/noctua-py
